                <p>A router is a device that forwards data packets along networks. A router is connected to at least two networks, 
                  commonly two LANs or WANs or a LAN and its ISP's network. A router is a device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks.</p>

                <p>A switch is a hardware device that filters and forwards network packets from one networking device to another. It is widely used in local area networks (LANs) to send each incoming message frame by looking at the physical device address, known as the Media Access Control address (MAC address).</p>

                <p>A layer 3 switch is a network switch with some router functions. The most important purpose of the layer 3 switch is to speed up the data exchange within a large LAN. The routing function is also used for this purpose. It can accomplish on-route and multiple packet forwarding processes.</p>

                <p>A bridge operates at the data link layer. A bridge is a repeater with the added functionality of filtering content by reading MAC addresses of the source and destination. It is also used for interconnecting two LANs working on the same protocol. It has a single input and single output port, thus making it a 2-port device.</p>
